# Material UI Demo

This app is a MaterialUI demo that takes a random house image from unsplash, diferent everytime that you load, and shows it in the cards of the album. It is based on the album template of the MaterialUI page, but I code it manually to practice. It was built with ReactJS and it's deployed on Vercel. It is responsive for mobile and tablet.
